# Time-Series-Analysis-Energy-Consumer-Prices-in-the-US

## 1. Project Overview
This project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting using real-world macroeconomic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database.
The goal was to analyze long-term trends, seasonality, and temporal dependencies in selected economic indicators and evaluate classical statistical models for forecasting.

The project was carried out as part of academic coursework, but structured as a complete analytical pipeline, from data acquisition to interpretation of results.

## 2. Objectives
- Explore and understand temporal patterns in economic time series
- Identify trend and seasonality components
- Verify stationarity and apply appropriate transformations
- Build and compare classical time series models
- Generate short-term forecasts and interpret their limitations
